Hello Researchers!

After the All Staff Didactics break last week, we’re ready to jump back into R. Remember most tasks have more than one way of tackling them; if we got different answers, though, we should figure out why.

We’re starting data visualization and analysis this week, and these next two sessions will be more interactive than the first two.
