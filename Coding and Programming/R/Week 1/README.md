Hello researchers!

In Didactics tomorrow morning, we’re going to begin a four week introduction to programming in the language [R](https://www.r-project.org/).

This week we plan on covering

* An introduction to the language: installation & RStudio interface
* Data Types and Structures
* Basic Operations
* Manipulating Strings

If you’d like to get a head start, here are some links that have roughly the same scope as tomorrow’s discussion:

* [“① Intro to basics” through “⑥ Lists”](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r).
* [“1. R Syntax”](http://tryr.codeschool.com/). Some of what we’ll talk about tomorrow is included in later sections of Try R, but we’re going through the material in a different order than Code School.
* The videos in [“Introduction” through “Getting Started”](https://www.udemy.com/learn-r-by-intensive-practice/). Some of what we’ll be talking about tomorrow is also included in "Vectors (In-depth)" through "R Packages, Strings, Dates and Functions", but, like with Code School, some of that we’ll get to later.
* [“Data Structures”](https://ramnathv.github.io/pycon2014-r/learn/structures.html) (the whole page).
* [“9.4 Data types and data structures”](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/ItDT/HTML/node64.html) (the whole page).
* [“3. Basic Operations and Numerical Descriptions” through “3.2. Basic Numerical Descriptions”](http://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/R/basicOps.html).

For the very curious, interested, or technically minded:

* The first two chapters plus chapter three through section “3.1.4 Operators” in [the official R documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-lang.pdf).

Don’t feel obligated to go through all of this material in advance; follow your curiosity and skill level. We’ll have some exercises for you to try after Didactics each week so you can dig in and get some practice and practical experience with the language.
