This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
help("<-")
```

Assign a numeric value, an integer, a character value, and a logical value to variables

```{r}
my_num <- 3.0
my_int <- 12L
my_char <- "twelve"
my_logical <- FALSE
```

Look up the special characters available in R.

```{r}
?Quotes
```

Assign a string that includes one or more special characters to a variable.

```{r}
my_special_char <- "\t"
```

Create a vector with the variables you've already assigned. See what types each element in the vector is.
```{r}
my_vector <- c(my_num, my_int, my_char, my_logical, my_special_char)
typeof(my_vector)
```

Create a list with the same variables you used in the above vector. See what type each element in the list is.
```{r}
my_list <- list(my_num, my_int, my_char, my_logical, my_special_char)
typeof(my_list[[1]])
typeof(my_list[[2]])
typeof(my_list[[3]])
typeof(my_list[[4]])
typeof(my_list[[5]])
```

Create a matrix with 4 columns containing the numbers 21:80 with each row containing consecutive numbers (e.g. 21, 22, 23, 24).
```{r}
my_matrix <- matrix(21:80, ncol = 4, byrow = TRUE)
```

Add a row to the matrix with 81:85.
```{r}
my_matrix <- rbind(my_matrix, c(81:84))
my_matrix <- rbind(my_matrix, c(85, NA, NA, NA))
```

Make a family_member dataframe with columns for name, gender, and age with at least five rows.
```{r}
name <- c("Jon", "Sarah", "Chris", "Sharon", "Messy", "Mei Mei", "Ben", "Olivia")
gender <- c("M", "F", "M", "F", "F", "M", "M", "F")
age <- c(30L, 30L, 56L, 56L, 25L, 23L, 26L, 0L)
family_member <- data.frame(name, gender, age)
```

Create a factor from the gender column of the dataframe.
```{r}
gender_factor <- factor(family_member$gender)
```

Print the age column of the dataframe.
```{r}
family_member$age
```

Assign the value of the first element of the fifth row of the dataframe to a new variable.
```{r}
sister_name <- family_member[5,][[1]]
```

Divide my_num by my_int. Find the integer quotient and the remainder.
```{r}
my_num / my_int
my_num %/% my_int
my_num %% my_int
```

Try to do some math using a my_char and/or my_special_char.
```{r}
my_char * my_int
```

Look at the help for paste. Try to concatenate a sentence with a comma using the paste function.
```{r}
help(paste)
paste("Try to concatenate a sent", "nce with a comma using the paste function.", sep = ",")
```
