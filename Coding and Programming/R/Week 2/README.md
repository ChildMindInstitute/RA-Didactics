Hi everyone,

Tomorrow in RA Didactics, we’ll be covering the following topics: 

* File handling
* More operations
* Boolean logic / conditional statements
* Loops

Per request, we’re providing the slides and example code beforehand, in case you want to look at them today or be able to follow along during the presentation tomorrow.

Finally, if you are interested, here are some pages that cover a few of tomorrow’s topics.
